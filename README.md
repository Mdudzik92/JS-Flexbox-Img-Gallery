<!-- Explanation of what the app is -->

This is a simple image gallery page in which the user can trigger the image panels on the screen to open with the click of their mouse. When the user clicks a panel, it expands and a word appears from the top and another from the bottom of the panel. When they click the same panel, it reverts back to the starting position.
